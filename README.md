# Inspiration
Our inspiration for working on Klatch stems from a deep-seated belief in financial inclusion and social impact. We've witnessed firsthand the disparities in access to real estate investment opportunities and the profound impact it has on communities. By creating Klatch, we aim to break down barriers, allowing everyone, regardless of financial means, to participate in real estate ownership. Our passion lies in harnessing the power of collective action to not only generate wealth but also to drive positive change and create stronger, more resilient communities for future generations.

## What it does
Klatch democratizes real estate investment, enabling individuals from diverse financial backgrounds to own tokens representing real property stakes. More uniquely, it empowers every investor with a vote. Through our innovative voting system, token holders can make decisions collectively on property management issues, renovations, and leasing terms, ensuring that all actions reflect the community's will, making the process transparent and fair.

## How we built it
We built Klatch by using the Bitcoin Lightning through Voltage to ensure fast and secure bitcoin transactions. Using this cutting edge technology, we built a web application using svelte, hardhat, remix, and three.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning a new and cutting edge technology like Voltage was a challenge given that none of us have worked with it in the past. This is expected given how we were using experimental features and the community is still small but growing. However, we were able to work with this technology by going through examples and getting support from the supportive mentors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take immense pride in Klatch's role in leveling the playing field in real estate investment. Our platform not only fosters financial growth but also cultivates a sense of community and shared purpose among its members. We are proud to have created a space where every participant has a stake in not only their financial future but also in the fabric of their community.

## What we learned
Working on this project has allowed us to learn how to create robust and secure bitcoin transactions in real world settings, as well as create visually appealing and robust web applications. Most of all though, we gained hands-on-experience in bringing cutting edge technology to societal issues that need more attention.

## What's next for KLATCH
Klatch serves as a fully functional demo on how we can bring more equity into the housing and real estate market. Next, we would like to contribute real world impact by partnering with real estate firms and allowing individuals to list their properties. We created the technology, now we just have to scale.
